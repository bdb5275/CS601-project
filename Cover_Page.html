                <h1>About Brandon</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Brandon was born on October 7th, 1995, in Honolulu, Hawai'i. He then went to spend
                        around 12 years in Shanghai until he graduated from high school. Brandon has an undergraduate
                        degree in Hospitality Management at Pennsylvania State University and a graduated degree in 
                        Corporate Finance at Pennsylvania State University as well. Currently, Brandon is living in 
                        his old childhood home in Honolulu and working as a well-known financial institution.
                    </p>
                    <p>Brandon has extensive experience working in financial institutions in an analyst role. His first role 
                        was at a small bank in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, where he worked as an entry-level financial analyst.
                        The role was a mix of accounting and reporting related tasks, with heavy emphasis on SQL and Excel.
                        Brandon's second role is at a prominent bank in Hawai'i as a risk management specialist, where he primarily
                        performs reporting related tasks. Just like the previous role, there was a lot of exposure to SQL and Excel,
                        but the current roles presents additional exposure to Python, R, and PowerPoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>As someone born in on an island paradise in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the sea naturally calls 
                        to Brandon's inner desires to explore the unseen depths. He spends much of his free time studying tidepools 
                        and fishing for new species of fish. Brandon particularly enjoys catching morays eels as he finds them to be
                        incredibly fascinating creatures. Sharks are also a favorite animal for Brandon, and unfortunately it is illegal
                        to catch sharks in Hawaii.
                    </p>
                    <p>In terms of element representation (see "Brandon's Genshin Impact Element Quiz" for more details), Brandon is strongly 
                        electro dominant. Meaning he is highly results-oriented and highly focused on achieving his desired outcome. Regrettably, 
                        his highly focused nature sometimes result in him getting tunnel vision, and ends up flagrantly disregarding the well-being 
                        and feelings of others around him. As an electro, Brandon is also not afraid to break conventions and challenge the 
                        status quo, sometimes saying things that make people uncomfortable or making family dinners awkward.
