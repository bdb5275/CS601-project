            <h1>About Genshin Impact And This Quiz</h1>
            <article>
                <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed by miHoYo, a Chinese game development studio. 
                    The game was released in September 2020 for multiple platforms, including Windows, PlayStation 4, and 
                    mobile platforms. The game is set in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is divided into seven distinct 
                    nations, each inspired by different real-world cultures and elements. Characters can also gain something 
                    called Elemental Visions, granting them control over one of the seven elemental powers: Anemo (wind), 
                    Geo (earth), Electro (electricity), Dendro (nature), Hydro (water), Pyro (fire), and Cryo (ice). How
                    characters gain visions seem to be related to their ambitions and how they strive to conquer the obstacles
                    preventing them from achieving it.
                </p>
                <p>Brandon noticed there seems to be some consistencies in how characters are given a vision and what type of 
                    vision they receive, and after extensively studying the lore and background of different characters, he 
                    was able to figure out the common denominator of how visions are given. To re-iterate, visions represents 
                    a character's ambition and drive, and most importantly how they go about navigating obstacles in order to 
                    reach their goals. This quiz seeks to replicate that process.
                </p>
                <p>NOTE: It is important to distinguish your goal from your work. A cashier working at 7-Eleven likely isn't 
                    pursuing his life goals so much as merely performing a task necessary for his survival, but once he get 
                    off work to practice opera singing at home, he most likely is engaging in him desire to become a famous
                    singer. Goals can also be long-term or short-term, such as the goal of saving one's country from terminal
                    decline or jumping on the computer play one's favorite video game. So please keep this in mind as you 
                    complete the quiz below.
