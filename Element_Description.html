            <h1>About The Pyro Element</h1>
            <img src="./assets/image/Pyro_Obstacle.png" alt="Pyro_Obstacle">
            <article>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>People with Pyro dominant element are often exalted by society and employers alike as the Model Citizen, and for 
                    good reasons too. Pyros can be characterized as high-achieving, results-oriented, hard-working, motivated, 
                    and optimistic individuals. When they decide on a goal they wish to achieve, they will often put in long hours 
                    of work to achieve it, and are not easily discouraged by setbacks. Pyros are also, more often than not, extroverted
                    and easy to get along with, and they naturally tend to attract others to their social circles. Not unlike their element,
                    fire, whose warmth will attract others to it.
                </p>
                <h2>Dealing with obstacles</h2>
                <p>When facing obstacles to their goals, Pyros tend to respond in a fairly straightfoward manner: to conquer it. To them, 
                    obstacles are like challenges that they must learn to overcome through hardwork and determination. Pyros will eagerly 
                    put in long hours to learn the intricate steps needed to craft the "key" to unlocking this obstacle.
                </p>
                <h2>How they compare to other element types</h2>
                <p>Pyros excel at achieving conventional success because of their tendency to deal with obstacles using conventional means. 
                    Obstacles, however, come in all shapes and sizes, and not all can be conquered using conventional means, some obstacles, 
                    in fact, are intentionally designed to keep others out. As such, other elements may have a far easier time dealing with 
                    these "unconventional" obstacles, such as the next element on the list.

            <h1>About The Electro Element</h1>
            <img src="./assets/image/Electro_Obstacle.png" alt="Electro_Obstacle">
            <article>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>At first glance, Electros might seem very similar to Pyros, as both are results-oriented and highly motivated. However, there 
                    are a number of key differences between the two: the first one, is that Electros are far more results-driven than Pyros, in fact
                    their key determining feature is their laser-focus on achieving their desired outcome; given the first point, the second defining
                    feature is that Electro have a lot less qualm about using less conventionally-acceptable means of achieving their goals; the third point,
                    given the preivous point, is that Electros don't mind being labeled as outcasts/pariahs/rejects/misfits/weirdos; and lastly, Electros
                    are often fiercly independent and fiercly protective of their identity, likely due to their experience growing up as outcasts.
                </p>
                <h2>Dealing with obstacles</h2>
                <p>While Pyros view obstacles as challenges to overcome, Electros view obstacles as just that, an obstacle, and therefore
                    needs to be obliterated. Using whatever means necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>How they compare to other element types</h2>
                <p>Now it might seem like Electros are just ruthless villains willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want, and 
                    if you look up a list of generic Hollywood villains you will likely find an over representation of Electros, but it should be
                    clarified that all elements are equally capable of being villains, it is simply that Electro type villains require a lot 
                    less writing to get the audience to hate them. It should also be clarified that conventional does not always relate to social moral codes,
                    but rather the relative setting someone is in. Consider a family of professional criminals, the Pyro brother will try to achieve success 
                    by engaging in criminal activities and he will do so proudly, whereas the Electro sister might prefer to achieve success through
                    honest hard work like the black sheep she has always been.

            <h1>About The Hydro Element</h1>
            <img src="./assets/image/Hydro_Obstacle.png" alt="Hydro_Obstacle">
            <article>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Hydros embody the essence of pursuing goals as a cherished hobby rather than a relentless pursuit of success. Individuals with a
                    Hydro dominant element are fueled by their deep passion and genuine love for what they do. Their approach to life's challenges
                    is rooted in the joy of their pursuits, and they find fulfillment in the journey itself, not just the destination. A Hydro's passion 
                    can create a very inspiring aura that naturally attracts people into their social circles. They bring a sense of calm and joy to 
                    those around them, inspiring others to find fulfillment in their passions as well.
                </p>
                <h2>Dealing with obstacles</h2>
                <p>When faced with obstacles, Hydros don't see them as insurmountable barriers but rather as opportunities to refine their craft.
                    Their mindset is akin to mastering a beloved hobby, and they relish the practice, improvement, and the joy that comes from doing
                    what they love. Hydros believe that with dedication and continuous effort, obstacles will naturally dissipate over time. Even if the 
                    obstacle does not dissipate, as far as a Hydro is concerned, they are doing what they enjoy and alone is enough to be the reward.
                </p>
                <h2>How they compare to other element types</h2>
                <p>In contrast to the driven nature of Pyros and the results-focused approach of Electros, Hydros prioritize the intrinsic value
                    of their endeavors, and are inherently much less results-driven. They are content with the process of honing their skills and 
                    don't measure success solely by external achievements, and are very unlikely to have outbursts of anger and frustration when 
                    they encounter setbacks.

            <h1>About The Cryo Element</h1>
            <img src="./assets/image/Cryo_Obstacle.png" alt="Cryo_Obstacle">
            <article>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Cryos epitomize the art of accepting things unconditionally, finding tranquility in the midst of life's challenges. Individuals with a
                    Cryo dominant element possess a unique ability to embrace circumstances with a serene acceptance, distinguishing them from other elements.
                    Their inner peace is unwavering, and they approach both success and setbacks with a calm demeanor.
                </p>
                <h2>Dealing with obstacles</h2>
                <p>When encountering obstacles, Cryos stand out by their capacity to acknowledge limitations without resistance. Rather than tirelessly striving
                    to overcome challenges, they gracefully accept the reality and remain at peace with the situation. Cryos understand that some goals may
                    remain out of reach, and they find solace in the wisdom that comes from embracing life's uncertainties. In contrast, Cryos excel at overcoming 
                    internal conflicts and challenges, precisely because of their willingness to embrace reality and all its bitter truth.
                </p>
                <h2>How they compare to other element types</h2>
                <p>Compared to other elements, there is little doubt that Cryos are by far the worst at overcoming external obstacles. However, their strength 
                    lies in their remarkable ability to swiftly recover from emotional and internal challenges, such as dealing with the loss of a loved one. In 
                    comparison, a Pyro might fall into a deep depression, an Electro will boil in anger and self-hatred, a Hydro might seal itself in its own safe
                    space, a Cryo will simply accept things as they are and move on.

            <h1>About The Anemo Element</h1>
            <img src="./assets/image/Anemo_Obstacle.png" alt="Anemo_Obstacle">
            <article>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Anemos, like the wind they embody, are free-spirited individuals content to let the breeze carry them wherever it pleases. These individuals possess
                    a unique ability to navigate life with a sense of freedom and spontaneity. When faced with obstacles, Anemos tend to take off in a new direction,
                    exploring alternative paths that lead to the same goal or embarking on entirely different pursuits. Anemos are masters of adaptability, finding joy 
                    in the unpredictable twists and turns of life. They possess a natural creativity that allows them to discover innovative solutions and alternative 
                    routes to reach their desired outcomes.
                </p>
                <h2>Dealing with obstacles</h2>
                <p>Obstacles are merely detours for Anemos, opportunities to explore different avenues. Rather than confronting challenges head-on, they prefer to dance
                    with the winds of change. For an Anemo, there could be dozens, if not hundreds, of different paths that lead to the same outcome, so why would they
                    waste time on a path that is blocked and inaccessible. Even if all paths are completely blocked off, Anemos don't see the need to pursue that one specific 
                    goal, and they would happily pursue a much more attainable alternative instead. It can even be argued, that Anemos cannot truly fail at achieving their 
                    goal, because they simply refuse to be tied down to just one goal.
                </p>
                <h2>How they compare to other element types</h2>
                <p>The reactions of other elements toward Anemos can be quite mixed, some might see them as lazy and even irresponsible, some might be inspired
                    by their care-free nature, and some might admire their creativity, but none of this matter to an Anemo as they are happy to look for greener pastures. 
                    Anemos are quite similar to Electros in the sense that they tend to be highly independent loners, albeit due to entirely different 
                    reasons: Electros are loners because other groups reject them; Anemos are loners because they reject the very concept of being part of a group.

            <h1>About The Geo Element</h1>
            <img src="./assets/image/Geo_Obstacle.png" alt="Geo_Obstacle">
            <article>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Geos exude confidence and embody a stoic resilience akin to rocks that withstand external forces. Unaffected by adversity, individuals with a Geo dominant
                    element remain steadfast in the pursuit of their goals. Due to their high confidence, they naturally come off as highy dependable individuals and people 
                    naturally flock to their leadership.
                </p>
                <h2>Dealing with obstacles</h2>
                <p>When faced with obstacles, Geos adopt a patient and methodical strategy. Similar to the slow erosion of rocks shaping landscapes over time, Geos are content
                    to chip away at challenges gradually. They possess an innate ability to withstand the test of time, patiently waiting for the right moment to overcome
                    obstacles and continue their journey. To Geos, slow and steady will always win the race.
                </p>
                <h2>How they compare to other element types</h2>
                <p>Unlike Pyros and Electros, Geos generally don't think there are quick easy ways to achieve success. To them, it is far better to have a reliable, albeit slower, 
                    strategy that they can utilize over and over. Compared to Hydros or Anemos, Geos may feel similar in that all three types don't appear to be in a hurry to 
                    achieve their goals, where Geos differ is that they still ultimately want to arrive at their desired destination. It may or may not be surprising to know, 
                    that some of the most successful investors and business people are likely Geo dominant.

            <h1>About The Dendro Element</h1>
            <img src="./assets/image/Dendro_Obstacle.png" alt="Dendro_Obstacle">
            <article>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Dendros are driven by the ultimate pursuit of knowledge, embodying a logical and fact-driven approach to life. Their goals resemble comprehensive research theses,
                    where the aim is to uncover every aspect of subjects they care about. Dendros are characterized by their deep intellectual curiosity and a relentless desire to
                    understand the intricacies of the world around them.
                </p>
                <h2>Dealing with obstacles</h2>
                <p>When faced with obstacles, Dendros view them as integral parts of the research process. Rather than seeing challenges as hindrances, they perceive them as
                    opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of the subject at hand. Dendros strive to dissect obstacles, seeking to comprehend why they exist and how they
                    can be removed. Every impediment is a puzzle to be solved, contributing to their overarching goal of acquiring comprehensive knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>How they compare to other element types</h2>
                <p>In contrast to elements driven by passion, achievement, or adaptability, Dendros stand out for their methodical and analytical approach. While others may focus
                    on external success or creative solutions, Dendros find fulfillment in the pursuit of pure knowledge. Out of all element types, a Dendro might struggle to 
                    understand a Hydro the most, as they tend to be driven by emotions and passion rather than by logic and facts. Interactions involving a Dendro and a Hydro 
                    are often quite entertaining to watch.
