                <article>
                    <h2>Items Needed</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heavy duty hook - adult morays can easily bent out regular hooks</li>
                        <li>200lb steel line - adult morays can easily snap 75lb steel lines</li>
                        <li>Nylon net - to immediately secure the eel after pulling it out</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Where to fish for morays</h2>
                    <p>Generally speaking, sandy beaches generally don't make good spots since they tend to 
                        lack places for morays to hide in and therefore you are not likely to find them there.
                        Instead, look for rocky coasts as morays prefer to hide in reefs and crevices when they 
                        are not hungry. Do be careful however, as rocky coasts tend to have turbulent waves so 
                        you can't just pick any rocky coast you want. Tidepools can also be a good choice and they
                        tend to be safer, but you are also unlikely to find larger morays there due to the limited
                        food supply there. Ideally, you want to find a rocky coast that's safe from the surges, but also 
                        offer a comfortable spot for you to be in a resting position without having to be in the water
                        yourself. Trust me, you do not want to be in the water with hungry moray eels.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How to find morays</h2>
                    <p>This is a fairly straightforward step. Moray eels have an extremely developed sense of smell, all 
                        you really need is something with a strong enough smell to entice them to come seek you out. Through 
                        experience, Brandon has found that by far the best bait to use is mackerel. Due to their oily flesh 
                        and pungent smell, moray eels find them absolutely irresistible and will actively seek out the source 
                        of the smell. If you cannot use mackerel then any oily fish should do as well, salmon scraps are a very 
                        good alternative. Once you have your bait, you want to cut in up and place them into a nylon net bag or 
                        something similar, then dip the bag into the water and allow the waves to carry the scent out. If you 
                        picked a good spot then it won't take long before you see a moray eel.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Technique</h2>
                    <p>Now that you have attracted the eel to you, what you do next will decide whether you go home triumphant or 
                        limp home as some eel-less loser. Continue to keep the bait bag in the water to entice the eel to approach
                        closer, once it is close enough you drop your hook (with bait on) directly infront of the eel. As long as the 
                        hook is baited with conventional bait (ex: squid, fish, shrimp), the eel will take the bait. Let the eel swallow
                        the hook a little before setting your hook and you could then drag him out. The beauty about using heavy duty 
                        steel lines is that you don't have to worry about tension, nothing smaller than a person will be strong enough to snap a 
                        200lb line. When you hooked the eel, make sure you keep tension and drag it as soon as you can, you do not want it 
                        to slip into a crevice otherwise you will likely never get it out. After you successfully pull out the eel, make sure
                        you secure it immediately by putting it into a sturdy nylon bag or else it might wiggle free.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>This method is no doubt very unconventional, and you are unlikely to encounter another fishman using 
                        a similar technique to catch morays, likely because people often don't like catching them or eating them. This 
                        method was developed by Brandon after dozens of setbacks and failure, and to this day he is still perfecting and improving
                        his technique to one day catch the biggest moray eel.
